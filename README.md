# DS-projects
I will build 3 projects using different machine learning algorithms to solve the real problems I had in my research:
1) using K-means and Hierarchical Clustering Analysis to my Geochemistry dataset and extract the key chemofacies to unravel the hidden signals;
2) using Random Forest and Decision Tree to explore my well log data to predict rock types;
3) Ensemble several machine learning algorithms to analyze producation water quality data and try to figure out the critical mineral variations;
