Cluster Analysis for Rock Typing
Description: K-means clustering is used to discover primary rock types in a deep well drilled in the Williston Basin. The project begins by identifying primary rock types for a large section of rock spanning ~9,000’, then focuses on a smaller section of rock (~60’) to identify specific layers in a reservoir. Two unique models are built, however the process is only covered one time as the only difference is the amount of data fed into the model.

Data Context:
Operators drilling for oil and gas want to understand the subsurface reservoirs that they are trying to produce from, and one of the most common ways of doing so is by “logging” a well. A well is drilled vertically to some depth, and a tool is run inside the hole with sensors and measurements are taken. From these measurements, we infer properties about the rock that cannot be measured directly such as porosity, permeability, and oil saturation. Different rock types such as sandstones, limestones, and claystones have distinctly different readings on these tools. Here I hope to provide a very high level overview of some of the common logs.

Gamma Ray (GR): Measures the natural radioactivity of the rock
Density (RHOZ): Measures electron density, which is closely tied to bulk density
Neutron (NPHI): Measures the hydrogen content of the formation which is related to its porosity and/or mineralogy
